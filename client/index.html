            The left sidebar shows the progressbar and when it is moving up that is the time to move your 
            character. Above the progressbar is your players face and above the face is your players stamina.

        <li>
            To use the powerups you must catch a diamond and then you will see a diamond icon on the top 
            left corner and to use it you must press x and your stamina will increase in the next turn.
